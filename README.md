# PascalVoc-Label-Drawer
This script is used to draw labels on images and save them. It takes in a folder containing the images, a folder containing the corresponding XML annotations, and an output folder where the labeled images will be saved. The script also takes in two optional arguments: --overlay and --font_size.
